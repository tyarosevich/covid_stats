Note that creating a pip requirements.txt file from a conda env should be done with:

pathtopip/pip list --format=freeze > requirements.txt

Simply using freeze gives weird symbolic links.


Also note that you must commit changes befor deploying to EB.

Deployment workflow:

alter python files
adapt dockerfile from other projects if need be - do not use conda envs (memory reasons)
may have to get AWS credentials to log in with eb cli - they are the standard key/secret key in the CSV file.
may have to log in to docker
docker build -t <image name> .
docker run <image name>
click on link to check locally. if port issues you can do docker run -p XXXX:XXXX to get a specific port and go to http://0.0.0.0:XXXX or something like that
If it's working:
eb init
eb create

Options just need to be sensible. AWS LInux 2 / Application / etc
