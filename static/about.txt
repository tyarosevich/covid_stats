Amidst the tragedy of the Covid-19 epidemic, the world has an unprecedented opportunity to bear witness to how science can impact our lives, and how a vaccine can radically change the course of a disease. 

The purpose of this simple dashboard is to try to demonstrate the raw correlation between vaccination and mortality as this epidemic continues, in the hopes that it will reinforce the casual viewer's faith in the importance of safe vaccination. All visualization focuses on vaccination and mortality in order to try to give an intuitive sense of their relationship as the vaccination effort proceeds. Note that the option to shift the the vaccination data forward 3 weeks is very unscientific, and is simply done to show correlation for vaccinations after their effects would impact the average 18.5 day infection duration for fatal cases. In practice, far more advanced methods are used to account for this, and it should be taken with a grain of salt - the vaccination impact will become evident over time regardless. 

All of the data used is freely available from the CDC and the U.S. Census Bureau. If you have any questions about this dashboard, please feel free to click the link to my website below and use the email link, or visit the github repo.
